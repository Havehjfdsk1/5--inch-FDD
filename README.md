This is my first ever project, and boy is it an undertaking. After realizing that I don't want to buy a 5 1/4 inch floppy drive I decided to make one myself.
I've never used any circuit design programs but today I will learn.
Plans:
  Recreate a 5.25 inch floppy disk drive with new parts.
  Create a BOM 
  A cad or a circuit board project file
	Make this look nice
